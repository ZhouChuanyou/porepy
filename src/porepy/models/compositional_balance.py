    The initialization parameters can contain the following entries:

    - ``'eliminate_reference_phase'``: Defaults to True. If True, the molar fraction
      and saturation of the reference phase are eliminated by unity, reducing the size
      of the system. If False, more work is required by the modeller.
    - ``'eliminate_reference_component'``: Defaults to True. If True, the overall
      fraction of the reference component is eliminated by unity, reducing the number
      of unknowns. Also, the local mass constraint for the reference component is
      removed as an equation. If False, the modelled must close the system.
    - ``'normalize_state_constraints'``: Defaults to True. If True, local state
      constraints in the equilibrium problem are devided by the target value. Equations
      relating state functions become dimensionless.
    - ``'use_semismooth_complementarity'``: Defaults to True. If True, the
      complementarity conditions for each phase are formulated in semi-smooth form using
      a AD-compatible ``min`` operator. The semi-smooth Newton can be applied to solve
      the equilibrium problem. If False, the modeller must adapt the solution strategy.

    The primary, transportable variables are:

    - pressure
    - (specific molar) enthalpy of the mixture
    - ``num_comp - 1 `` overall fractions per independent component

    The secondary, local variables are:

    - ``num_phases - 1`` saturations per independent phase
    - ``num_phases - 1`` molar phase fractions per independent phase
    - ``num_phases * num_comp`` extended fractions of components in phases
    - temperature

    The primary block of equations consists of:

    - pressure equation / transport of total mass
    - energy balance / transport of total energy
    - ``num_comp - 1`` transport equations for each independent component

    The secondary block of equations represents the local equilibrium problem formulated
    as a unified p-h flash:

    - ``num_comp - 1`` local mass conservation equations for each independent component
    - ``num_comp * (num_phase - 1)`` isofugacity constraints
    - ``num_phases`` semi-smooth complementarity conditions for each phase
    - local enthalpy constraint (equating mixture enthalpy with transported enthalpy)
    - ``num_phase - 1`` density relations per independent phase

    In total the model encompasses
    ``3 + num_comp - 1 + num_comp * num_phases + 2 * (num_phases - 1)`` equations und
    DOFs per cell in each subdomains, excluding the unknowns on interfaces.

    Example:
        For the most simple model set-up, make a mixture mixing defining the components
        and phases and derive a flow model from it.
